Welcome!
========
This is the Disruptive Technologies Python 3 API. It is an extension of our various tools described in the `Developer Documentation <https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/docs/>`_, with some added quality-of-life features that python makes possible. This makes interacting with your devices even easier!

Get Started!
------------
Our Python API currently consists of 2 separate packages.

- :ref:`disruptive <client_quickstart>`: A Python wrapper for our REST API.
- :ref:`dtintegrations <integrations_quickstart>`: Validates and decodes Data Connector events.

Head over to either of their quickstart-pages to get going with only a few lines of code.
