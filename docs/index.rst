Disruptive Python API
=====================
This is the Disruptive Technologies Python 3 API. It is a wrapper for our `REST API <https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/api>`_ and other tools described in the `Developer Documentation <https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/docs>`_, with the added convenience of Python.

Getting Started
---------------
Our Python API currently consists of 2 separate packages.

- :ref:`disruptive <client_quickstart>`: A Python wrapper for our REST API.
- :ref:`dtintegrations <integrations_quickstart>`: Validating and decoding Data Connector requests at receiver.

Head over to either of their quickstart pages to get started.
