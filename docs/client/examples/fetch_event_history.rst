Fetch Event History
===================
In this example, a device's humidity events is fetched and printed for the past 7 days.

Full Example
------------
The following snippet implements the example. Remember to set the environment variables.

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   
   import disruptive as dt
   
   # Fetch credentials and device info from environment.
   key_id = os.getenv('DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID', '')
   secret = os.getenv('DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET', '')
   email = os.getenv('DT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL', '')
   device_id = os.getenv('DT_DEVICE_ID', '')
   project_id = os.getenv('DT_PROJECT_ID', '')
   
   # Authenticate the package using Service Account credentials.
   dt.default_auth = dt.Auth.service_account(key_id, secret, email)
   
   # Define the start-time from when events are fetched.
   seven_days_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(7)
   
   # Fetch humidity events from the past 7 days.
   events = dt.EventHistory.list_events(
       device_id=device_id,
       project_id=project_id,
       event_types=[dt.events.HUMIDITY],
       start_time=seven_days_ago,
   )
   
   # Iterate through the list of fetched events.
   for event in events:
       # Isolate a few values contained within the event.
       event_id = event.event_id
       timestamp = event.data.timestamp
       humidity = event.data.humidity
   
       # Print a formatted string of the isolated information.
       print(f'{humidity}% humidity from event {event_id} at {timestamp}.')

This will produce an output similar to the following snippet.

.. code-block:: bash

   60% humidity from event c2f6e07km0nusv59v10g at 2021-05-14 12:03:12.500464+00:00.
   24% humidity from event c2f6dvvkm0nusv59v0vg at 2021-05-14 12:03:11.128840+00:00.
   24% humidity from event c2dre6vkm0nusv59od3g at 2021-05-12 11:08:11.833330+00:00.

Explanation
-----------
Using `Service Account <https://developer.disruptive-technologies.com/docs/service-accounts/introduction-to-service-accounts>`_ credentials, the entire package can be authenticated at once by setting the :code:`dt.default_auth` variable with an Auth :ref:`authentication method <authmethods>`.

.. code-block:: python

   dt.default_auth = dt.Auth.service_account(key_id, secret, email)

Once authenticated, a the event history of a device can be fetched using the :code:`list_events()` resource method, but first we use the standard :code:`datetime` library to define our start time.

.. code-block:: python

   # Define the start-time from when events are fetched.
   seven_days_ago = datetime.now() - timedelta(7)

The start time is provided to the event history method, which executes the request.

.. code-block:: python
   
   # Fetch humidity events from the past 7 days.
   events = dt.EventHistory.list_events(
       device_id=device_id,
       project_id=project_id,
       event_types=[dt.events.HUMIDITY],
       start_time=seven_days_ago,
   )

The response is a list of :ref:`Events <client_events>` which we can iterate through in a loop. Within each event, various information is then extracted and printed.

.. code-block:: python

   for event in events:
       # Isolate a few values contained within the event.
       event_id = event.event_id
       timestamp = event.data.timestamp
       humidity = event.data.humidity
   
       # Print a formatted string of the isolated information.
       print(f'{humidity}% humidity from event {event_id} at {timestamp}.')
